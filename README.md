# Classification-of-Biochemical-molecules-using-a-graph-kernel-based-on-Energy-and-Total-Variation
This code classifies molecules represented by graphs using Joint Total variation and Energy similarity measure (JET),  embeded in a Support Vector Machine as a kernel. The classification problem is to determine whether the molecule is mutagenic or not.  For more details and exploitation in further research work, Please refer to our paper:       H. Ahmed, Bay-Ahmed, Delphine Dare, and Abdel-Ouahab Boudraa.
